About Website:

We crafted our website for the topic- Digital Teen Indians and created a imaginary organanization - "Digital Teens" - India Organization. As per our story line, Digital Teens is an organization which showcases digital teens and their stories throughout the world. The website is a platform where the Indian organization of Digital Teens named as "Digital Teens- India" showcases the stories of some notable stories of Indian teenagers who are icons of the new digital age.

Tech Specs:

The website is made using following languages:
(1) HTML ; (2) CSS; (3) JavaScript (4) Jquery

The website is built from scratch without the use of any premade templates or designs. Bootstrap has been used for a particular section - "Stories" to organise thumbnails in a responsive grid. 

JQuery plugins used are SmoothScroll.js and intro-animation-section.js. The website is otherwise original.

Design:

The website follows the strict guidelines of Flat design which is most popular design trend of 2014-2016. 

The logo for Digital Teens Indians has been made with Photoshop and is original. The thumbnails used in Stories section are made in Photoshop and are original. Base24 format icons are used. 

JavaScript is used as well in front-end.
